# Recipe Generator 

I was inspired to create this application due to the amout of effort you have to put in to find the details on a recipe, searching the web it seems like theres a life story aattached to the recipe and you have to scroll for ages before you actually find the ingridients. I designed this app to remove that hasle from the process, All information is easily accessible and straight forward.

# Using the App

Using the app is extremely easy, all you have to do is enter your ingredients into the search field and press enter! Once you've done that you will be met by 20 recipes with ingredients listed. There are a few options from this point on, if you dont like the results you can edit the search to a more specific recipe or if you like the results the app showed you just click on "Recipe Instructions" to go directly to the url where the recipe is held. There is also a more details route, this shows some specific details about the recipe, such as calories and time to cook. Returning back to the search option from details is very easy, just click the return to search in the top left corner.

# Stretch goals 

Unfortunately I wasn't able to apply a filter search to the app, where a user can click a button and the value of that button will fill into the search input.

Ability to move pages, currently there is a set amount of recipes that will come back froma search. There needs to be a load more or next page function implemented.

A filter out search, I want the user to be able to filter out ingredients they dont want included in the recipe because many people have allergies or intolerances.
